The code scripts can be viewed in sequential order.

Main part of the analysis with generating most of the figures
* [A. Main analysis and resulting figures [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/A.%20Main%20analysis%20and%20resulting%20figures%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb) 
* [B1. Solution of the control problem including the universal line + Sensitivity analysis [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/B1.%20Solution%20of%20the%20control%20problem%20including%20the%20universal%20line%20%2B%20Sensitivity%20analysis%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)

Whereas, three variations for different values of the cost of resistance: </br>
* [B2. (lower cost of resistance) Solution of the control problem including the universal line + Sensitivity analysis [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/B2.%20(lower%20cost%20of%20resistance)%20Solution%20of%20the%20control%20problem%20including%20the%20universal%20line%20%2B%20Sensitivity%20analysis%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)
* [B3. (higher cost of resistance) Solution of the control problem including the universal line + Sensitivity analysis [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/B3.%20(higher%20cost%20of%20resistance)%20Solution%20of%20the%20control%20problem%20including%20the%20universal%20line%20%2B%20Sensitivity%20analysis%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)
* [B4. (much higher cost of resistance) Solution of the control problem including the universal line + Sensitivity analysis [Python].ipynb*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/B4.%20(much%20higher%20cost%20of%20resistance)%20Solution%20of%20the%20control%20problem%20including%20the%20universal%20line%20%2B%20Sensitivity%20analysis%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)

Sensitivity analysis:
* "[C1. Sensitivity analysis [R].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/C1.%20Sensitivity%20analysis%20%5BR%5D.ipynb)". 
* "[C2. Sensitivity analisys - second part - computations for Fig S7 [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/C2.%20Sensitivity%20analisys%20-%20second%20part%20-%20computations%20for%20Fig%20S7%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)". 

Construction of the field of optimal trajectories:
* [D. Field of optimal trajectories [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/D.%20Field%20of%20optimal%20trajectories%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)
* [D-2. Field of optimal trajectories for different time horizons [Python].ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/D-2.%20Field%20of%20optimal%20trajectories%20for%20different%20time%20horizons%20%5BPython%5D.ipynb)

Lastly, generation of last two figures (possibly the naming is incorrect):
* [E. Figures 6 and 7 [R].ipynb](aakhmetz/AkhmKim2019Scripts/blob/master/scripts/E.%20Figures%206%20and%207%20%5BR%5D.ipynb)
